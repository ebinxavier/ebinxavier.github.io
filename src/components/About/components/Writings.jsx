            I am a Software Engineer from Kochi, India. I am having{" "}
            {new Date().getFullYear() - 2016}+ years of experience in the
            software industry. I have a bachelor's degree in{" "}
            <b>Computer Science and Engineering</b> from{" "}
            <b>Cochin University of Science and Technologies</b>. My area of
            expertise is web development. I am interested in both frontend and
            backend technologies but most of my experience lies on frontend
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started my career as a programmer analyst (an entry level
            engineer) at <b>Cognizant</b>. From there I got an industrial
            exposure to software development especially to web development. I
            worked there on
            <b> Angular.js, HTML and CSS</b>. Then I got some projects in{" "}
            <b>Node.js</b> and it opened the world of server side programming. 
            After a couple of years I moved to another company <b>QBurst</b>{" "}
            as an intermediate level frontend engineer. There I worked on{" "}
            <b>Angular 2+ and Material UI</b>, also I got a chance to work with
            Web automation using Selenium web driver and Node.js to automate some tasks.
            Fortunately I got an opportunity to work with
            <b> React.js</b>, I did a
            bunch of projects on this awesome tech.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a year I moved to <b>Datalkz</b>, a Dubai based
            start-up company. This is the first time I am
            working for a start-up. The work culture, attitude to time
            constrained product delivery everything was different for me. I
            learned <b>GraphQL, Next.js, Docker, Redis</b> and much more from
            Datalkz. I worked here for more than 2 years and moved back to Kochi.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently I am working at <b>IBM India Software Labs</b> in Kochi as a Fullstack developer.
            Here I am working in OpenPages which is a part of IBM cloud, a huge amount of work is happening in the IBM Cloud 
            and I am looking forward to learn new things from here!
          </p>

            I love music production, playing Guitar, preparing different cuisines, 
            making mobile games, 3D modeling, I always keep an eye on theoretical physics and
            popular science, making DIY projects using
            ESP32, Arduino and Raspberry Pi and exploring more... <span role="img">ðŸ˜Ž</span>.
